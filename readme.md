# Hello There!
I am an **AI Engineer** based in London UK. I've previously worked at [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) as a Software Engineer where I was responsible for fixing high-priority, time-sensitive production issues everyday affecting 100M+ users worldwide. After working on traditional software, I decided to shift gears and focus on AI - an area that has always fascinated me since especially since I first saw the movie [Robo - 2010](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1305797/). 

Now, I work on building complex multi-agent systems that make lawyers life easier. Whether itâ€™s optimizing algorithms, training models, or solving complex engineering problems, I enjoy the challenge of making stubborn things work smarter and better.

During weekends, you can find me:
1. Fine-tuning LLMs - [Find my work here](https://huggingface.co/dumbequation)
2. Open-source Projects - Follow for updates!
3. Doing hackathons on AI - 6+ wins
4. Experimenting with Model Architectures
