# Hello There!
I am an **AI Engineer** based in London, I've previously worked at [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft). My interests are **building solutions powered by LLMs**, **serving LLMs** experimenting with **model architectures**.

I love solving real problems with AI and I've won numerous hackthons trying to achieve that.
